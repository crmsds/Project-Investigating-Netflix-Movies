# Project: Investigating Netflix Movies
 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset

This repository explores the hypothesis that movies are getting shorter over time. Motivated by a DataCamp challenge, I conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset (netflix_data.csv). The goal is to uncover and understand potential factors contributing to the observed trend of decreasing movie durations.
